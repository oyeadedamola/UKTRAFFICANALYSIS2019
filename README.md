# UK road accident analysis for 2019

The goal of the project was to analyse road traffic and accident for the year 2029 in UK an provide possible solutions/changes to reduce the occurence of road accidents.

Methodology

# Cleaning of data
This involes carefully checking the data types of each columns, changing data inputed in the wrong format, removing duplicated rows, deleting rows that were clearly inputed wrongly. Python functions such as unique, replace, unique, isnull, replace etc. was used to achieve this. Also, I had to create functions to make cleaning of some columns easier and more effective. python packages such as numpy, pandas, pandas-profiiling was used to achieve this.

# Merging of tables
Three tables was used for the analysis. I had to ensure the tables are linked in the right way and with the right columns to avoid mutliple or lesser data when working on the analysis

# Visualisation

This was done after the data has been satisfactorily cleanded and all outliers has been removed. Python packages such as seaborn, matplotlib etc was used to visualize the data to have a better understanding of the census data of the community.

# Modelling

The data was trainded using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,
Adaboost and Niave bayes algorithms. The outcome was compared with goverment model. Logistic Regression model performed best with the government model at 91.3%

# RECOMMENDATION AFTER ANALYSIS
❖ From my analysis, Metropolitan has high accident occurrence (17.82%), there will be
need to implement strict road traffic rules particularly for metropolitan.

❖ Surprisingly, 72.99% of accidents was recorded in single carriage way, hence, there
will be need to revaluate traffic rules guiding single carriage ways, such as speed limit,
bumps interval etc.

❖ From analysis, a high accident count was recorded for pedestrians at 8:00am, 4:00 pm,
5:00 pm and peak at 3:00 pm. This may be due to movement of students before and after
school. There will need to educate students at schools on importance to obey traffic rules.
Also, traffic wardens should be deployed at pedestrian accident-prone locations at the
peak hours of pedestrian accidents.

❖ For pedestrian, motorcycle and the accident record generally experienced high accident
count, there will need to increase presence of traffic wardens to help monitor traffic on
Fridays.
